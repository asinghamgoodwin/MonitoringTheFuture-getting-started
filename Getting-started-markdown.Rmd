```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
require(haven)
```

I can use the `haven` package (part of the tidyverse) to read SAS files
```{r import_from_SAS, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
df1 = read_sas(data_file = "data/12th-grade-2016-2018/y2018_1.sas7bdat")
knitr::kable(df1[1:5,1:8])
```

Or just read a CSV exported from SAS.
*Note: I'm getting a lot of problems here, but I suspect it's from my original SAS work, rather than the importing step*
```{r import_from_CSV, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
df2 = read_csv(file = "data/ALLYEARS_81012.csv")
knitr::kable(df2[1:5,1:8])
```

# Goal #1: Reproduce a smaller version of [Table 5 from the MTF 2018 report](http://www.monitoringthefuture.org//pubs/monographs/mtf-overview2018.pdf#page=59&zoom=100,0,0)

Specifically: lifetime prevalence for any vaping and ever being drunk, split up by grade, for 2016-2018 (highlighted below).

## Step 1: get core data from all 3 years and grades into 1 table

I'll keep the cigarette, vaping, and alcohol indicators for "ever used" (lifetime prevalence) as well as "last 30 days":

Combine information from all grades across all 3 years:

colnames(eight_ten_combined) == colnames(twelve_combined)

# summary(all_three_grades_and_years)
```

Here's my first attempt at using the [`table1` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/table1/vignettes/table1-examples.html). It looks beautiful in RStudio! (not as great in markdown) But also all of these numbers are very wrong... so at some point I'll need to investigate why.
```{r table1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
require(table1)
knitr::kable(table1(~ grade | year*alc_drunk_lifetime, data = all_three_grades_and_years))
```

Instead of using `table 1`, I'm just trying to get the 18 numbers in Table 5 from my data. ~~It looks like sometiems the `NA`s should be in the denominator, and other times they shouldn't....~~ Now that I've added the weights, it looks lke the NAs are always excluded from the counts in Table 5.

Create a function to calculate and extract percentages by grade and year, for a specific indicator. Things I learned:
* [Tidy eval](https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org/introduction.html), which allows me to pass column names into a function.
* (didn't end up using here): if you have a column name that starts with a number, you can refer to it by surrounding in backticks.
* `stop()` function for errors
```{r percentage_function}
# NOTE: table must have columns called "year", "grade", "weight", and "variable"
# the "variable" column must be factors, where we care about levels "Yes" and "No" and ignore anything else
get_percentage_by_grade_and_year = function(table = table, variable = variable) {
  if (!all(c("year", "grade", "weight", variable) %in% names(table))) {
    stop(paste(sep = "", "table must contain year, grade, weight, and (your input) ", variable, " columns"))
  }
  
  # get raw counts
  counts = table %>% 
    group_by(., year, grade) %>% 
    count(., !!sym(variable), wt = weight)
  
  # get the "percent yes" for each year/grade group...
  percent_yes = counts %>% 
    pivot_wider(., names_from = !!sym(variable), values_from = n) %>% 
    mutate(.,
           percent_yes = (Yes / (Yes + No))*100
    ) %>% 
    select(., year, grade, percent_yes) %>% 
    pivot_wider(.,
                names_from = year,
                values_from = percent_yes
    )
  
  percent_yes
}
```

Print out the tables:
```{r table_5_copies, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table1 = get_percentage_by_grade_and_year(table = all_three_grades_and_years, variable = "alc_drunk_lifetime") %>%
                mutate(., change_2017_2018 = `2018` - `2017`)

table2 = get_percentage_by_grade_and_year(table = all_three_grades_and_years, variable = "vape_ever") %>% 
                mutate(., change_2017_2018 = `2018` - `2017`)

knitr::kable(list(table1, table2),
             digits = 1,
             caption = "Lifetime prevalences of 'Been Drunk'(above) and 'Any Vaping'(below)",
             valign = 't')
```

# Goal #2: Reproduce trend graphs from the [NIDA for Teens interactive chart](https://teens.drugabuse.gov/teachers/stats-and-trends-teen-drug-use)

Specifically, I'd like to make [this view](https://public.tableau.com/shared/JF2B545PM?:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link&:embed=y), showing 8th, 10th, and 12th grade trends in past-30-day alcohol use and vaping, from 2016-2018.

First, create two tables for past-month rates by grade and year:
* *NOTE:* I'm getting a warning about factors and implicit NA <-- worth learning about later
```{r tables_30_day}
alcohol_past_month = get_percentage_by_grade_and_year(table = all_three_grades_and_years, variable = "alc_month")
vape_past_month = get_percentage_by_grade_and_year(table = all_three_grades_and_years, variable = "vape_any_month")

knitr::kable(alcohol_past_month, digits = 1)
knitr::kable(vape_past_month, digits = 1)
```

Making the graphs! Things I learned:
* It's important to specify a group for ggplot, because whatever the default was (from the `group_by()`? no groups?) didn't work, even if I'd specified splitting up by grade some other way, like with the color
* Different ggplot geometries correspond to continuous vs. discrete variable types. It seems like `geom_line()` and `geom_point()` both play nicely with a continuous `y` and a discrete `x` (which I bet is pretty common)
* It's easier to do graphing if data is in a "tidy" format
* The `patchwork` library makes it easy to arrange multiple plots together
  * *Note: I bet actually I should use faceting for this? And combine the data all into one tibble.*
* Question: how do I avoid getting the `a` labels in the legend?
```{r past_month_by_grade}
library(patchwork)

# this function is (so far) only for the very specific purpose of taking a user-readable table of one variable (by grade and year) and converting it into a plot of that one variable over the years 2016-2018
plot_by_grade = function(table = table, title = title, y_label = y_label) {
  # tidy data by making it longer
  data_to_plot = table %>% 
    ungroup(.) %>% 
    pivot_longer(.,
                 cols = `2016`:`2018`,
                 names_to = "year",
                 values_to = "percent")
  
  # create a plot
  plot = ggplot(data_to_plot,
                aes(x = year, y = percent, group = grade, color = grade)
  ) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    labs(
      title = title,
      x = "Year",
      y = y_label
    ) +
    geom_text(label = round(data_to_plot$percent, 1), nudge_x = -.2, nudge_y = .5) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(5, 35)) + 
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
  
  plot
}

plot_by_grade(table = alcohol_past_month,
              title = "Alcohol: past month",
              y_label = "Average percent useage per grade") +
  plot_by_grade(table = vape_past_month,
                title = "Any Vaping: past month",
                y_label = "") 
```

# Questions:
* What should I do about the weights?
  * *Is it correct to just be including it as a weight in R's count function?*
* Should I include missing data in the denominator for prevalences?
  * *If I'm just matching other people's data, it seems like all NAs should get thrown out. Is there some systematic way to understand (maybe from the codebook?) when this is appropriate and when it isn't?*
* How should I weight something if I'm trying to combine 8th, 10th, and 12th grades? (like [Table 1](http://www.monitoringthefuture.org//pubs/monographs/mtf-overview2018.pdf#page=59&zoom=100,0,0) from the report))
* For a question like *V2566: BY18 34230 EVER VAPE (2018 codebook, p. 56, 12th grade)*, what does 70% missing mean? Were some large amount of participants not asked? 
* In SAS, I do `proc freq` a ton, just to check up on how my data manipulation is going, and catch any surprises. What's the corresponding workflow in R?
  * I've been using `summary()` but I'm not in love yet
